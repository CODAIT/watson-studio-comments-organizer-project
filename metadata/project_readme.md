What is an accelerator?
- Industry Accelerators are a packaged set of technical assets used to help you tackle your next data science project by addressing your most pressing business challenges. With sample data, notebooks, scripts, a sample application and more, you can kickstart your own implementation and leverage the power of Cloud Pak for Data.

Key challenges
- 84% of the people trust reviews as much as personal recommendation. 95% of consumers are influenced by online reviews for their purchase. More than four negative reviews about a company, brand or product can decrease sales by 70%.
- To stay relevant and trustworthy, managing online reputation is imperative
- Unmanaged feedback can cause loss of opportunity to connect with customers, understand expectations of customers, and address the problems
